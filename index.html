                Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’
                s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’
                . From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education.
                 In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies, plans,
                  programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                   State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Educational reforms are the need of the hour…..
                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
             For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
                 I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might turn out to be too late.
            Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.
            For example, financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from different subject specializations.
             A shift from the theoretical framework to a practical framework will certainly help the c I do understand that in a country as big and diverse as ours it is surely “easier said than done” but it surely should be on the top of the government bucket list. Small steps can be taken if the whole “revolution” seems unfeasible. Sports and Yoga too are great ideas that very well should be incorporated in the school curriculum and the govt is doing good on this…
             Lastly, education as rightly is incomplete with the right value sets… somewhat a spirit of coordination should prevail over competition among students today which largely seems missing… a rat race for marks only highlights the state of education as on now…

Parents/carers are empowered to become proactive in supporting their own children’s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have included a reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced risk for mental disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
                This initiative aims to improve the health and wellbeing of parents & children through nurturing resilience.
                The programme will build resilience amongst children and their carers and supports families develop skills and knowledge in these areas:
