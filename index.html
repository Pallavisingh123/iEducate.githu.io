                    Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the
                    command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the
                    Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and
                    compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate
                    ratio
                    of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education
                    are
                    numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of
                    India’
                    s constitutional states.

                    The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance”
                    for
                    India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it
                    should
                    quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                    unemployment,
                    waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India
                    it cannot
                    be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after
                    defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                    Fresh Little Minds ‘Lets GROW Together’ programme is a targeted early intervention programme tier
                    2–3
                    intervention for carers/parents and child/ren to undertake together.
                    This intervention has been successful in supporting and deescalating the stresses experienced by
                    many
                    families on waiting lists for CAMHS & ASD services. Parents/carers are empowered to become proactive
                    in
                    supporting their own children’s emotional wellbeing and coping strategies. Results have included a
                    reduction in overwhelm, more empowered parents, and a clinical prediction for reduced risk for
                    mental
                    disorders including depression, anxiety, concentration disorder and ASD.
